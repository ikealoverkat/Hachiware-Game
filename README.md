# hachiware game
this is an infinite runner game similar to the chrome dino game but with hachiware from the chiikawa IP! i made this game quickly because i wanted to build a project before school starts (ew) and i also wanted to make a project about the chiikawa IP because it's my favourite IP and hachiware is my favourite character!! 
## how i made my project
things i used:
- kaplay
- vite
- VSCode
- krita
1. first, i drew hachiware's running animation in krita
2. i downloaded some official chiikawa art off pinterest & the artist (nagano)'s twitter to act as the obstacles for hachiware!
3. i imported all my assets into my game directory
4. i coded the game with kaplay (the javascript framework)
5. i exported the game with npm run build & zipped the folder it generated
6. i uploaded the .zip file to itch.io
7. yay a game!!!
## what i struggle with & what i learned
- i struggled to make the obstacles spawn with all the different options because i forgot rand existed
- i remembered rand existed so the obstacles spawned yay
- i struggled with the hitboxes of my obstacles before i realized there was a ton of empty space around the images i used so the hitbox was around the empty space and not the actual obstacle...
- i fixed it by cropping my images lol

yay!! have fun lol
